This option can be used to avoid raising Ecto.StaleEntryError. :stale_error_message - The message to add to the configured :stale_error_field when stale errors happen, defaults to &quot;is stale&quot;. See the &quot;Shared options&quot; section at the module documentation for more options. Examples A typical example is calling MyRepo.insert/1 with a struct and acting on the return value: case MyRepo.insert %Post{title: &quot;Ecto is great&quot;} do {:ok, struct} -&gt; # Inserted with success {:error, changeset} -&gt; # Something went wrong end Upserts c:insert/2 provides upserts (update or inserts) via the :on_conflict option. The :on_conflict option supports the following values: :raise - raises if there is a conflicting primary key or unique index :nothing - ignores the error in case of conflicts :replace_all - replace all values on the existing row with the values in the schema/changeset, including autogenerated fields such as inserted_at and updated_at :replace_all_except_primary_key - same as above except primary keys are not replaced {:replace, fields} - replace only specific columns. This option requires conflict_target a keyword list of update instructions - such as the one given to c:update_all/3, for example: [set: [title: &quot;new title&quot;]] an Ecto.Query that will act as an UPDATE statement, such as the one given to c:update_all/3. If the struct cannot be found, Ecto.StaleEntryError will be raised. Upserts map to &quot;ON CONFLICT&quot; on databases like Postgres and &quot;ON DUPLICATE KEY&quot; on databases such as MySQL. As an example, imagine :title is marked as a unique column in the database: {:ok, inserted} = MyRepo.insert(%Post{title: &quot;this is unique&quot;}) Now we can insert with the same title but do nothing on conflicts: {:ok, ignored} = MyRepo.insert(%Post{title: &quot;this is unique&quot;}, on_conflict: :nothing) assert ignored.id == nil Because we used on_conflict: :nothing, instead of getting an error, we got {:ok, struct}. However the returned struct does not reflect the data in the database. One possible mechanism to detect if an insert or nothing happened in case of on_conflict: :nothing is by checking the id field. id will be nil if the field is autogenerated by the database and no insert happened. For actual upserts, where an insert or update may happen, the situation is slightly more complex, as the database does not actually inform us if an insert or update happened. Let&#39;s insert a post with the same title but use a query to update the body column in case of conflicts: # In Postgres (it requires the conflict target for updates): on_conflict = [set: [body: &quot;updated&quot;]] {:ok, updated} = MyRepo.insert(%Post{title: &quot;this is unique&quot;}, on_conflict: on_conflict, conflict_target: :title) # In MySQL (conflict target is not supported): on_conflict = [set: [title: &quot;updated&quot;]] {:ok, updated} = MyRepo.insert(%Post{id: inserted.id, title: &quot;updated&quot;}, on_conflict: on_conflict) In the examples above, even though it returned :ok, we do not know if we inserted new data or if we updated only the :on_conflict fields. In case an update happened, the data in the struct most likely does not match the data in the database. For example, autogenerated fields such as inserted_at will point to now rather than the time the struct was actually inserted. If you need to guarantee the data in the returned struct mirrors the database, you have three options: Use on_conflict: :replace_all, although that will replace all fields in the database with the ones in the struct/changeset, including autogenerated fields such as insert_at and updated_at: MyRepo.insert(%Post{title: &quot;this is unique&quot;}, on_conflict: :replace_all, conflict_target: :title) Specify read_after_writes: true in your schema for choosing fields that are read from the database after every operation. Or pass returning: true to insert to read all fields back: MyRepo.insert(%Post{title: &quot;this is unique&quot;}, returning: true, on_conflict: on_conflict, conflict_target: :title) Alternatively, read the data again from the database in a separate query. This option requires the primary key to be generated by the database: {:ok, updated} = MyRepo.insert(%Post{title: &quot;this is unique&quot;}, on_conflict: on_conflict) Repo.get(Post, updated.id) Because of the inability to know if the struct is up to date or not, inserting a struct with associations and using the :on_conflict option at the same time is not recommended, as Ecto will be unable to actually track the proper status of the association.

It expects a schema module (MyApp.User) or a source (&quot;users&quot;) or both ({&quot;users&quot;, MyApp.User}) as the first argument. The second argument is a list of entries to be inserted, either as keyword lists or as maps. The keys of the entries are the field names as atoms and the value should be the respective value for the field type or, optionally, an Ecto.Query that returns a single entry with a single value. It returns a tuple containing the number of entries and any returned result as second element. If the database does not support RETURNING in INSERT statements or no return result was selected, the second element will be nil. When a schema module is given, the entries given will be properly dumped before being sent to the database. If the schema contains an autogenerated ID field, it will be handled either at the adapter or the storage layer. However any other autogenerated value, like timestamps, won&#39;t be autogenerated when using c:insert_all/3. This is by design as this function aims to be a more direct way to insert data into the database without the conveniences of c:insert/2. This is also consistent with c:update_all/3 that does not handle timestamps as well. It is also not possible to use insert_all to insert across multiple tables, therefore associations are not supported. If a source is given, without a schema module, the given fields are passed as is to the adapter. Options :returning - selects which fields to return.

This overrides the prefix set in the query and any @schema_prefix set in the schema. :on_conflict - It may be one of :raise (the default), :nothing, :replace_all, :replace_all_except_primary_key, {:replace, fields}, a keyword list of update instructions or an Ecto.Query query for updates. See the &quot;Upserts&quot; section for more information. :conflict_target - A list of column names to verify for conflicts. It is expected those columns to have unique indexes on them that may conflict. If none is specified, the conflict target is left up to the database. It may also be {:constraint, constraint_name_as_atom} in databases that support the &quot;ON CONSTRAINT&quot; expression, such as PostgreSQL, or {:unsafe_fragment, binary_fragment} to pass any expression to the database without any sanitization, such as ON CONFLICT (coalesce(firstname, &quot;&quot;), coalesce(lastname, &quot;&quot;)).

For example, if :on_conflict is set to :nothing, Postgres will return 0 if no new entry was added while MySQL will still return the amount of entries attempted to be inserted, even if no entry was added.
